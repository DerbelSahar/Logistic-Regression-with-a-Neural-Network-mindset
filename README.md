# Logistic-Regression-with-a-Neural-Network-mindset
neural networks and deep learning (week 2 cousera cours)
In this assignment you will:

- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.

- Learn how to minimize the cost function.

- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.
